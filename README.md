# MysticalMechanics
Standalone mechanical power for Minecraft.

This mod library adds the basics of a mechanical power system. Originally in Embers source code but it was extracted and can run on its own with a few extensions.

Current Features
  Iron Axles (Reference Implementation)
  Gearboxes, as designed for use in Embers. Gears must be inserted into these on all faces where axles should connect. Power output is input divided by number of connected outputs.
  Iron Gears (Reference Implementation) (Supports oredicted iron gears)
  Creative Source for testing
  Gears can have different behaviors for power transfer implemented. Should be flexible enough to produce interesting transfer mechanics.
  Redstone control
  Merger Gearboxes
  Gearbox and axle reorientation
  Lubricant API
  
Planned Features
  More robustness
  Min and max length restrictions for axles
